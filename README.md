# Coffee-Sales-Dashboard

## Project Overview

This project is a comprehensive analysis of coffee sales data, designed to showcase my data analysis skills. The project involves gathering, cleaning, and visualizing data from various sources to provide insights into coffee sales performance across different regions, customer segments, and product types.

I have built an interactive dashboard that allows users to explore sales trends, top-performing products, and key customers using slicers and timelines. This dashboard is part of my Data Analyst portfolio and demonstrates my expertise in data wrangling, analysis, and visualization.
